# SwagLanguagePack

## An unified language extension for [Shopware 6](https://github.com/shopware/platform).

### Description
The path to internationalisation is an exciting one and requires quite a bit of work - everything needs to be set up perfectly; from the currency to choosing the right shippingprovider and, of course, the right languages and so much more. With the numerous plugins and interfaces available in the Community Store, you already have access to a large selection and many options to help drive your internationalisation.

Shopware’s new language plugin now quickly and easily provides you with an array of languages to choose from. This way, you can set up your admin and/or storefront with different languages and take the next step towards internationalisation with no trouble at all. With this extension you now have over 10 languages at your disposal in just one plugin. You no longer have to activate a plugin for each language. One plugin – many languages.

The following languages are already available (more to follow):
* Bosnian
* Czech
* Danish
* Dutch
* Finnish
* French
* Hungarian
* Indonesian
* Italian
* Latvian
* Norwegian  
* Polish
* Portuguese
* Romanian
* Russian
* Spanish
* Swedish
* Vietnamese
* more to follow soon (Serbian, Turkish, etc.)

This extension will continue to be supported by the Shopware project in Crowdin. Find out more about Crowdin here. Of course, you can also translate and contribute to new languages in the Shopware Community.
